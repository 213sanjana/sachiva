# 🌟 Welcome to Sachiva: Contribute Like a Pro

Hello there! 👋  
We’re thrilled that you’re considering contributing to **Sachiva** — a stylish, modern front-end project built with **HTML, SCSS, CSS, and JavaScript**. Whether you’re a first-time contributor or an experienced developer, this guide is your go-to roadmap to start contributing confidently.

This file breaks down every step so clearly that even if you’ve **never contributed to open source**, you'll walk away saying: *“Damn, that was smooth.”*

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Sachiva is built using:
- **HTML5** – Semantic and clean markup.
- **SCSS** – Preprocessed styling for scalability.
- **CSS3** – Styling magic.
- **JavaScript (vanilla)** – Lightweight interactivity.

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A GitHub account (of course)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other code editor
- Basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JS (you’re learning, that’s enough!)

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

Here’s how to go from zero to contributor:

---

### 1. 🔱 Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button on the top-right corner of this page. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

---

### 2. ⬇️ Clone Your Fork

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sachiva.git
````

This will clone the forked repo to your local machine.

---

### 3. 📍 Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd sachiva
```

---

### 4. 🌿 Create a New Branch

Never work on `main` directly.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Examples:

* `feature/navbar-redesign`
* `fix/footer-overflow`
* `docs/update-readme`

---

### 5. 🛠️ Make Your Changes

Open the project in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

Now add your features, fix bugs, improve UI, update content — whatever contribution you're making.

---

### 6. 🧼 Code Style Guidelines

* Follow consistent HTML indentation (2 spaces)
* Write SCSS using nesting responsibly
* Use semantic tags (`<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
* Use meaningful commit messages (see below)
* Keep PRs small and focused (1 change per PR ideally)

---

### 7. 💬 Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added responsive navbar"
```

Follow this format:

```
<type>: <description>
```

**Commit Types:**

* `feat` – New feature
* `fix` – Bug fix
* `style` – Styling only (no logic)
* `docs` – Documentation only
* `refactor` – Refactor code
* `chore` – Build tools or config

---

### 8. ⬆️ Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

### 9. 🔃 Create a Pull Request (PR)

* Go to your forked repo on GitHub.
* Click **“Compare & pull request”**.
* Add a clear title and description.
* Link related issues if any.
* Click **Create Pull Request**.

---

### 10. 🧪 Review & Feedback

* Your PR will be reviewed by a maintainer.
* You might be asked to make some changes (don’t worry, it's normal!).
* Once approved, it will be merged.

And just like that — you’re an open source contributor 🎉
